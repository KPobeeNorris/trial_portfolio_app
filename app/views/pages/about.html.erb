  <p class="lead">I am a Housing Support worker turned developer who cares about having a positive impact on the end-userâ€™s life, and enjoys working with others to find creative solutions to challenges faced. I am loyal, seriously hard working, set high standards for whatever job I do, am able to work well with others; and most importantly I love bringing laughter to the people I work with. I am looking for a role where I can continue to develop my skills, to be part of building things that change people's lives, and want to work for a company that cares for it's staff's wellbeing.</p>
